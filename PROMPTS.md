I'm making a SvelteKit project deployed on Cloudflare Pages using durable objects. How should I structure my project files

Can you give me an overview on how a typical CloudFlare pages project is created from beginnning to end? Give me cloudflare specific things I need to be wary about like routing and the wrangler.toml file.

I'm trying to use a Durable Object with Cloudflare Pages, but the deployment fails. What's the standard architecture? After reading, it seems like a recommended approach is to have two folders inside the main project directory, one for front end and one for backend (the do). Should the DO be in its own Worker project?

What is the point in using Cloudflare types and why does the normal types for Request fail in a cloudflare web app.

My wrangler tail log is showing TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'run') when I try to call the AI. My code is env.AI.run(). What could cause env.AI to be undefined?

My WebSocket connection keeps dropping and showing 'Connecting...' when I'm idle. What are recommended approaches in computer networking to fix this issue. Take a real world example and explain it to me. How does something like chatgpt.com fix this issue?

Give me a lightweight example of how to use tick in svelte for reactive statements.

My deployment is failing with Error 8000109: Script not found. My wrangler.toml is trying to bind my Pages project to my Durable Object worker. What's wrong with the binding configuration?

Ensure I included all necessary components to develop, test, and explain usage in this readme.md file (then pasted readme.md file contents).
